LearnPythontheHardWay
=====================

Directory of my files working through the exercises in Zed Shaw's book Learn Python the Hard Way

The file will be named for the exercise (example: ex22.py)

The file extension will either be .py for the python script or .txt for a sample text file I was working with.

ex__.py is the original typed out exercise from the book.

For the study questions and drills I will use drill in the file name (example: ex20drill.py).\n
The drill files are where I make changes to the original or use # to make notes.
The number after drill doesn't necessarily correlate to the specific Study Drill question from that exercise.
Sometimes I'll go beyond what I learned in a particular lesson and there will be multiple drill files.

I'll also use "test" in some file names
