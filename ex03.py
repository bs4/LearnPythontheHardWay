# The below line asks a True/False statement, Powershell does the math and kicks back the answer

# The below lines shows the answer to lines 15 and 16 as True / False

# PEMDAS Parentheses  Exponents  Multiplication  Division  Addition  Subtraction (Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally) 

# + plus , does addition
# - minus , does subtraction
# / slash , does division
# * asterisk , does multiplication
# % percent or modulus , does division BUT the "answer" to the equation is the remaining number ex.- 20 % 3 = 2 , 20 / 3 = 6 and 2 left over
# "" modulus equation X / Y with J remaining, ex.- 100 / 16 with 4 remaining. The result of % is the J part, or remaining part
# < less-than , returns True/False based on values (or value of resutling equation) on each side of it
# > greater-than , returns True/False based on values (or value of resulting equation) on each side of it
# <= less-than-equal , returns True/False based on values (or value of resulting equation) on each side of it
# >= greater-than-equal , returns True/False based on values (or value of resulting equation) on each side of it
