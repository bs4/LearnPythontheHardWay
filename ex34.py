# NOTE: The idea behind this exercise is straight forward:
## ordinal vs. cardinal
# I had a problem getting this to print in python, I figured it out tho

# see prints below, it's basically "print list[cardinal position]"

#animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
#bear = animals[0]


animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']



# the below line returns the number of items in the list
#print len(animals)

# the below line
#x = animals(


#1. The animal at 1. python, position 1
print animals[1]
#2. The 3rd animal. peacock, position 2
print animals[2]
#3. The 1st animal. bear, position 0
print animals[0]
#4. The animal at 3. kangaroo, position 3
print animals[3]
#5. The fifth animal. whale, position 4
print animals[4]
#6. The animal at 2. peacock, position 2
print animals[2]
#7. The 6th animal. platypus, position 5
print animals[5]
#8. The animal at 4. whale, position 4
print animals[4]
